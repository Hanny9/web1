  <p>Koreaâ€™s exports saw their steepest decline in over three years last month due to an ongoing slump in semiconductor prices and the U.S.-China trade dispute.</p>

  <p>It was the seventh consecutive month of on-year declines for Korean exports.</p>

  <p>Outbound shipments from Korea in the first half of this year fell 8.5 percent compared to the same period a year earlier. </p>

  <p>The government cited weakness in the semiconductor industry and the U.S.-China trade dispute for the drop in June. </p>
