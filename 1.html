  <p>The rainy season comes around every summer in Korea. We get a lot of rain during the season.
  It usually begins in mid-June and lasts until July. When it rains, it often rains <strong>cats and dogs</strong>.</p><p style="margin-top:15px;">

  <p><strong><u>The annual precipitation in Korea is concentrated in summer because of the rainy season.</u></strong>
  People always carry an umbrella around during the wet season.
  After the rainy season, <strong>the sweltering heat of summer begins in earnest.</strong></p>
